MULTIWINDOW SUPPORT

The state is stored on the window 
For buffers that only have 1 dsiplay window the state can stay on the buffer


The current window does not change unless:

  split-window - stay in same window but smaller, same buffer
  next-buffer - we switch to a new buffer, unassociate the old and associate the new with the current window
  other-window = we store state on the window
                 move to next window

The case where the same buffer is split across 2 or more displayed windows does ones head in !

Not sure of we need to store page and epage on the window structure.
does not appear to be needed when just associating 1 buffer with 1 window

All display code was written to take a buffer_t pointer otherwise
can not update other windows.
This forces other code to be written to take buffer_t args rather than use curbp.


PROBLEMS:

1) screwed insert. Point is not advancing after insert?
   This is serious defect - cant release like this, the editor is broken.
   going to have to backout all changes and re-apply one by one

2) Lower window scrolls funny at end of file when point=endp the whole file scrolls off the screen.
   The top window behaves as you would expect
   The display code framing code at the top of display() probably only works if you are a single window.
   Should work.  But need to think it through fully.
